# Python-Calculator
Create a basic calculator in Python.

I have created many projects that greatly impacted my software development career. Adding all the source code would require a lot of files, so I chose to add a simple program that I developed early in my career.

The source code is for a basic calculator I developed in Python. You choose two numbers and then have the option to add, subtract, divide, and multiply. After the calculation, the correct answer is displayed.
